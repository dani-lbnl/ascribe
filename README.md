# ASCRIBE

ASCRIBE (Autonomous Solutions for Computational Research with Immersive Browsing & Exploration) is a pioneering research project at the nexus of AI and Extended Reality (XR), designed to revolutionize scientific visualization and accelerate discovery. This initiative is developing AI-based algorithms for an integrated platform that leverages multimodal data, structural/chemical analyses, and immersive visualization for interactive exploration. ASCRIBE is uniquely positioned through strategic partnerships with leading centers, including CAMERA, CIWE, and Restor-C, granting access to advanced data sources such as X-ray CT, FIB-SEM, cryo-TEM, time-lapse plant imaging, and simulations, facilitating the creation of digital twins. ASCRIBE is structured around five core functionalities: data filtering, segmentation, quantification, immersion, and interaction. Tailored routines preprocess data to handle noise, anisotropy, and alignment, while AI-based semantic segmentation, steered by Gaussian Processes, enables precise calculation of Volumes of Interest (VOI) and other measurements. Prior-based postprocessing and validation are achieved through AI-driven autonomous loops, providing iterative feedback and uncertainty quantification. For immersive exploration, ASCRIBE develops XR-tools compatible with Meta Quest, powered by Unreal and Godot Engine and adhering to OpenXR standards, allowing ingestion and visualization of raw and reduced data, including VOI-based polygonal meshes and volume renderings. By integrating key technologies such as alignment, anisotropic diffusion, CNNs, viTs, LLMs, VTK, etc., ASCRIBE enhances how we visualize the outcomes of computer vision solutions, exemplified in structural analysis of water electrolyzer membranes. This convergence of AI and XR creates a sense of "presence", enabling researchers to explore complex concepts in virtual environments, accelerating scientific discovery in micro/nanostructure, and materials design.
